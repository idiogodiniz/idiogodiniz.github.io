The Simple Present Tense is one of the serveral forms of present tense in English. It is used to:

- Describe someone (is/are)
- Describe habits (do/does)
- Describe unchanging (permananent) situations (do/does)
- Describe facts (is/are or do/does)
- Describe fixed arrangements (something that was scheduled or set with time, where, or when) (do/does)
- Describe repeated actions or events (do/does)
- Describe instructions or directions (do/does)
- Describe emotions (is/are)
- Describe future constructions (will/be going to and do/does)

The simple present tense is simple to **form** without the verb be. Just use the **base form** of the verb, but the 3rd person singular takes an -s at the end.

> #### **Before we continue, we need to understand what subjects and verbs are**
> 
> - Verbs are action words. They tell us what is happening and when (past, present, future). Verbs can also express possibilities and conditions.
> - Subject is a person or thing that is being discussed, described, or dealt with (it is not the only one meaning of subject).

EXAMPLES
- For habits
    > We'll give it to her when she arrives

    > He drinks tea at breakfast

    > She only eats fish

    > They watch television regularly

- For repeated actions or events
    > We catch the bus every morning

    > It rains every afternoon in the hot season

    > They drive to Monaco every summer

- For unchanging situations
    > I never go to work by bus

    > She doesnâ€™t ever go to work by bus

    > He never goes to work by bus

- For facts
    > Water freezes at zero degrees

    > The Earth revolves around the Sun

    > Her mother is Peruvian

- For instructions or directions
    > Open the packet and pour the contents into hot water

    > You take the No.6 bus to Watney and then the No.10 to Bedford

- For fixed arrangements
    > His mother arrives tomorrow

    > Our holiday starts on the 26th March

    > With future constructions

    > She'll see you before she leaves

- With future constructions

    > She'll see you before she leaves

    > We'll give it to her when she arrives
<br />

**TIP:** To express future time, it always uses some conjunctions: after, when, before, as soon as, until, and others.
<br />

> Negative and question forms use DOES (the third person of the auxiliary 'DO') + the infinitive of the verb.
> - He wants ice cream;
> - Does he want strawberries?;
> - He does not want vanilla.

When the sentence is in the 3rd person singular form (he, she it), it **always** takes an **-s** at the end. And, we also need to know some rules before we try to form it.

> In the third person singular the verb always ends in -s (it doesn't apply to the irregular verbs):
> - Want &rarr; He wants
> - Need &rarr; She needs
> - Give &rarr; He gives
> - Think &rarr; She thinks

> Verbs ending in -y : the third person changes the -y to -ies:
> - Fly &rarr; She Flies;
> - Cry &rarr; He Cries.

> If there is a vowel before the -y:
> - Play &rarr; She Plays;
> - Pray &rarr; He Prays.

> Add -es to verbs ending in: -ss, -x, -sh, -ch:
> - Pass &rarr; He passes; 
> - Catch &rarr; She catches; 
> - Fix &rarr; He fixes;
> - Push &rarr; It pushes.
